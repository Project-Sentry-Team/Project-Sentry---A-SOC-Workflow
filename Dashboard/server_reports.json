The request attempted to inject a command that would download and execute a remote shell script from an attacker-controlled domain (attacker.com).",

Full forensic analysis is underway to determine if the payload was successfully executed. Remediation focuses on patching the vulnerable system's Bash version and limiting/removing unnecessary CGI functionality."
